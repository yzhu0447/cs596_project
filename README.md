# Parallel Monte Carlo for Radiative Transfer Using DPC++ 
This is a repository for CSCI 596 final project. The main topic is build a parallel monte carlo solver for radiative transfer problem using DPC++ language.

## Radiative transfer equation

## Monte Carlo method

## Performance tuning and load balancing
